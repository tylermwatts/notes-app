## Notes App

A simple web app for taking notes.

It uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) components for sleek(ish) styling.

The body of each note supports [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax) courtesy of the [marked](https://marked.js.org/#/README.md) package.

localStorage is used to persist notes between sessions.
